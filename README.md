# ChessCpp
Console program to play chess, written in C++

## Objective
Creation of a C++ console application to play chess by using OOP


## Why this project ?
This was an old assignement at the university, a C++ Chess console program, with several variations. Now, I would like to make it properly with a cleaer code as a hobby to maintain some C++ skils.


## Can anyone contribute ?
Yes !! Just get in touch to me and we will discuss what you want to implement or improve, so we do not work in the same idea at the same time, but I will be glad to collaborate with people.
