# ChessCpp
Console program to play chess, written in C++

## Objective
Creation of a C++ console application to play chess by using OOP


## Properties of the compilation
I am using Visual Studio 2019 as IDE, v142 and SDK version 10.0.
Also, I use C++ 17 (Norm ISO).


## Why this project ?
This was an old assignement at the university, a C++ Chess console program, with several variations. Now, I would like to make it properly with a cleaer code as a hobby to maintain some C++ skils.


## Can anyone contribute ?
Yes!! Just get in touch to me and we will discuss what you want to implement or improve, so we do not work in the same idea at the same time, but I will be glad to collaborate with people.


## What to expect from this project ?
Initially it will be just a game in the console to play 1v1. I would like to continue improving it afterwards, adding several features:
  - Basic game logic to play against the computer.
  - Basic game logic to play between players.
  - Logs of played games. 
  - Register several players, so it will be possible to select them to play and to see statistics about wins, draws and loses.


## Coordinates for the board

## NOTE
A rework on the architecture is ongoing to simplify the codebase and the dependencies between classes. Logic of the program shall be simplified.
